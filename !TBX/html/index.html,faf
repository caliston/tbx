<TITLE>TBX - RISC OS C++ Toolbox application library</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
 <p>tbx is a C++ library for developing RISC OS applications.</p>
 <p>
 This library uses the RISC OS toolbox modules for generating RISC OS
 user interface and provides event handling and utility classes to help
 in creating RISC OS applications.
 </p>
 <p>
 It is released under a free sofware licence (the X11 Licence) so that
 it can be freely modified and used by anyone.
 </p>
 <h3>Alpha Version 0.4</h3>
 <p>The current release is an alpha version with some ommissions and
 possibly a few bugs too!</p>
 <p>
 However it does have enough functionality to write full applications.
 If you try to use the library and need something that is missing please
 get in touch with me (alan_baa@hotmail.com).
