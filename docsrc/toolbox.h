/**
 * @page toolbox tbx and toolbox objects/components
 *
 * The tbx library provides a light wrapper around the toolbox objects,
 * gadgets and menu items.
 *
 * The classes to manipulate the toolbox objects can be treated as
 * references to the underlying toolbox object.
 *
 * Copying the C++ classes does not make a copy of the object, rather it
 * copies the reference so both classes refer to the same object.
