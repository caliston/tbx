Example TBX application to show using a TileView to produce a "filer"
like window.

Running the application puts an icon on the iconbar.

The iconbar menu gives two options.
- show the application information
- quit the application.

Clicking select on the iconbar shows the "Icons" window.

Drag files from a filer window to this window and the icon will
be added to the window.

The menu from the window allows you to select/unselect all the icons
in the window or remove icons from the view.
