The user guide is generated from the xml files in this
directory into the html subfolder.
Images for the guide are already in html/images.

The guide is generated using docbook. As there isn't
a current RISC OS version of xsltproc this has to
be done on another machine.

The shell script generate.sh does it on cygwin.
