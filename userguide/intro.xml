<title>Requirements</title>
<para>
TBX requires the GCC4.1 RISC OS compiler or later. To create/edit the toolbox resources you will need ResEdit or CCRes.
</para>
<para>The machine that builds a tbx program will need long filename support. The final applications can be theoretically run on a machine with RISC OS 3.1 onwards though some features may not work in such a case, but is tested and developed using RISC OS 4 and 5.
