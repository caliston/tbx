<p>
TBX is a C++ class library to help with the creation of RISC OS applications
that use the RISC OS Toolbox modules.
</p>
<p>
This is version 0.5 (Alpha version). It has a few missing features and may contain
some rough edges and bugs. Please send me feedback to improve this library.

with commercial and non-commercial applications without charge.</p>
